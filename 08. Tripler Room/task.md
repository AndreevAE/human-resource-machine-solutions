# Tripler Room

## Task

For each thing in the `INBOX`, **TRIPLE** it. And `OUTBOX` the result.

Self improvement tip: Where are we going with this? Please leave the high level decisions to management.

## Example

INBOX:  
`3` `-5` `5` `0`

OUTBOX:  
`9` `-15` `15` `0`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 6  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 24  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
