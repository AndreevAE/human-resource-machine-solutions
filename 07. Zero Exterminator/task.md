## Task

Send all things that **ARE NOT ZERO** to the `OUTBOX`.

You got a new command! It jumps **ONLY** if the valve you are holding is `ZERO`. Otherwise it continues to the next line.

## Example

INBOX:  
`1` `0` `4` `A` `0` `0` `-1` `0`

OUTBOX:  
`1` `4` `A` `-1`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 4  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 23  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
