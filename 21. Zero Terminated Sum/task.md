# Zero Terminated Sum

## Task

The `INBOX` is filled with zero terminated strings! What's that? Ask me. Your Boss.

Add together all the numbers in each string. When you reach the end of a string (marked by a **ZERO**), put your sum in the `OUTBOX`. Reset and repeat for each string.

## Example

INBOX:  
`4` `3` `0` `0` `7` `0`

OUTBOX:  
`7` `0` `7`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 10  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 72  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
