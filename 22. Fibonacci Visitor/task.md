# Fibonacci Visitor

## Task

For each thing in the `INBOX`, send to the OUTBOX the full Fibonacci Sequence up to, but not exceeding that value. For example, if `INBOX` is 10, `OUTBOX` should be 1 1 2 3 5 8. What's a Fibonacci Sequence? Ask your boss, or a friendly search box.

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 ...

## Example

INBOX:  
`20` `5`

OUTBOX:  
`1` `1` `2` `3` `5` `8` `13` `1` `1` `2` `3` `5`
