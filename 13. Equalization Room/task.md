# Equalization Room

## Task

Get two things from the `INBOX`. If they are **EQUAL**, put **ONE** of them in the `OUTBOX`. Discard non-equal pairs. Repeat!

You got... **COMMENTS**! You can use them, if you like, to mark sections of your program.

## Example

INBOX:  
`3` `3` `7` `7` `0` `-7` `1` `1`

OUTBOX:  
`3` `7` `1`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 9  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 27  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
