## Example

INBOX:  
`8` `5` `8`

OUTBOX:  
`8` `5` `8`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 6  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 6  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
