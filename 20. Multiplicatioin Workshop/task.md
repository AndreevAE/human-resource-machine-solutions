# Multiplication Workshop

## Task

For each two things in the `INBOX`, multiply them, and `OUTBOX` the result. Don't worry about negative numbers for now.

You got... **LABELS**! They can help you remember the purpose of each tile on the floor. Just tap any tile on the floor to edit.

## Example

INBOX:  
`2` `2` `0` `6`

OUTBOX:  
`4` `0`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 15  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 109  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
