# Small Divide

## Task

For each two things in the `INBOX`, how many times does the second fully fit into the first? Don't worry about negative numbers, divide by zero, or remainders.

Self improvement tip: This might be a good time to practice copying and pasting from a previous assignment!

## Example

INBOX:  
`6` `2` `9` `4` `4` `7` `0` `3`

OUTBOX:  
`3` `2` `0` `0`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 15  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 76  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
