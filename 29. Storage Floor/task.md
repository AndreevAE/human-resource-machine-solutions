# Storage Floor

## Task

Imagine each thing in the `INBOX` is an address. And each address refers to a tile 0-9 on the floor. Your task: For each address in the `INBOX`, pick up the letter at that address and `OUTBOX` it.

Congratulations! You can now access tiles on the floor **INDIRECTLY**! Observe this example to see how it works, compared to what you've been doing so far:

## Example

INBOX:  
`1` `0` `1` `3` `9`

OUTBOX:  
`K` `N` `K` `E` `J`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 5  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 25  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
