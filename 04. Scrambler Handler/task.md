# Scrambler Handler

## Task

Grab the first `TWO` things from the `INBOX` and drop them into the `OUTBOX` in the reverse order. Repeat until the `INBOX` is empty. 

You got a new command! Feel free to `COPYTO` wherever you like on the carpet. It will be cleaned later.

## Example

INBOX:  
`4` `8` `W` `E` `3` `8`

OUTBOX:  
`8` `4` `E` `W` `8` `3`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 7  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 21  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
