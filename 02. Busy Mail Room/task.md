## Task

Grab each thing from the `INBOX`, and drop each one into the `OUTBOX`.

You got a new command! You can drag `JUMP`'s arrow to jump to different lines within your program.

With this new ability, you can complete this assignment using only 3 total commands.

## Example

INBOX:  
`I` `N` `I` `T` `I` `A` `L` `I` `Z` `E`

OUTBOX:  
`I` `N` `I` `T` `I` `A` `L` `I` `Z` `E`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 3  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 25  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
