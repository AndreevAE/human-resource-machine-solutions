# Mod Module

## Task

For each two things in the `INBOX`, `OUTBOX` the remainder that would result if you had divided the first by the second. Don't worry, you don't actually have to divide. And don't worry about negative numbers for now.

## Example

INBOX:  
`6` `4` `7` `4` `4` `6` `0` `8`

OUTBOX:  
`2` `3` `4` `0`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 12  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 57  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
