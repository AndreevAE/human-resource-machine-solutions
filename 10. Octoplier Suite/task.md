# Octoplier Suite

## Task

For each thing in the `INBOX`, multiply it by 8, and put the result in the `OUTBOX`.

Using a bunch of `ADD` commands is easy, but **WASTEFUL**! Can you do it using only 3 `ADD` commands? Management is watching.

## Example

INBOX:  
`5` `-5` `2` `0`

OUTBOX:  
`40` `-40` `16` `0`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 9  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 36  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
