# Cumulative Countdown

## Task

For each thing in the `INBOX`, `OUTBOX` the sum of itself plus all numbers down to zero. For example, if `INBOX` is 3, `OUTBOX` should be 6, because 3+2+1=6.

## Example

INBOX:  
`3` `4` `0` `9`

OUTBOX:  
`6` `10` `0` `45`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 12  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 82  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
