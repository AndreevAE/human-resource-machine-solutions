## Task

For each two things in the `INBOX`, add them together, and put the result in the `OUTBOX`.

You got a new command! It `ADD`s the contents of a tile on the floor to whatever value you're currently holding.

## Example

INBOX:  
`2` `2` `3` `4` `-3` `6` `5` `-9`

OUTBOX:  
`4` `7` `3` `-4`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 6  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 24  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
