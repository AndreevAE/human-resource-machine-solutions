# Maximization Room

## Task

Grab **TWO** things from the `INBOX`, and put only the **BIGGER** of the two in the `OUTBOX`. If they are equal, just pick either one. Repeat!

You got a new command! Jumps only if the thing you're holding is negative. (Less than zero.) Otherwise continues to the next line.

## Example

INBOX:  
`4` `8` `-7` `-7` `6` `6` `-9` `-9`

OUTBOX:  
`8` `-7` `6` `-9`

## Optimizaiton Challenges

**Size Challenge:** 10  
Measures the number of commands in your program. Fewer is better.

**Speed Challenge:** 34  
Measures the number of commands your program must execute before it finishes, on average. Fewer is better. (Average computed by testing your solution against many deterministically generated input sets.)
